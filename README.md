## Overview

Valkyries are female figures in Norse mythology who serve Odin, the Allfather. Their name means "chooser of the slain" in Old Norse. They decide which warriors die in battle and which survive, then guide the slain heroes to Valhalla (Odin's hall) or Fólkvangr (Freyja's hall).

Depicted as beautiful, armored female warriors who ride winged horses or wolves through the air, they also serve as handmaidens in Valhalla, bringing mead to the einherjar (chosen warriors) who prepare for Ragnarök. Valkyries are associated with swans and can transform into swan-maidens.

Famous Valkyries include Brynhildr from the Völsunga saga, who was cursed by Odin for defying him.
